GUI for EWBF miner for monitoring (cool graphs) performance with restart capability.
Windows binary avaivable at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g16pbzd7gxgetgw/EWBF%20GUI.rar?dl=0.
Add conf.txt to folder for faster start up as without it program tries to find miner directory which is highly time consuming.

For running with python, required dependencies, that can be aquired with pip:
  - numpy
  - PyQt5
  - pyqtgraph
  - requests
  - psutils

Then run with: python full.py
Tested with python 3.5.2
